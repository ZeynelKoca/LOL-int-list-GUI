# Sisko's LeagueOfLegends Int List
An external application that makes use of the official League of Legends API to create an int list. The program saves all summoners in a file and can even delete them by putting 
a ' - ' in front of the summoner name. When active, it will read the League of Legends client process and once in champion select, will go through your teammates' summoner names.

When a player is found to be in your int list, the program will pop-up to the front screen and also make a quick "pop" sound. It will also list the summoner(s) that have been
found to be in your int list.
